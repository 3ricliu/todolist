Fun To Do List 

Current Features:
1. Can add new to dos (uses global array to hold to dos and their places when added)
2. Can complete existing to dos (will detect if null or actually exists)
3. Random "daily" quotes at the top of the list (quote becomes static for remaining life of the program before exiting)
